# Youtube-front-page-clone
A project in HTML and CSS
This is a personal project that I started when I started learning HTML and CSS. 
I used HTML and CSS to create and design the frontpage of Youtube.
Different CSS styles were used to to match the exact design of Youtube and the animations when you hover over certain things such as the sidebar icons.
